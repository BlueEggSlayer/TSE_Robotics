# TSE_Robotics
Repository that stores Copeliasim files and the code to extract sensor data from Copeliasim and process it to return it back to the user.

The "Backend module" folder, contains code that involves data manipulation, data IO operations and data recorded for usage in testing.

The "Frontend module" folder, contains code that displays the data, as well as create a user inferface for navigation.

The "Digital Robot Simulation" folder, contains files that were required to model and develop a digital prototype of a robot and a simulated environment that emulated real life conditions. Which includes multiple sensors and code modules to accompany it in order to record data and perform its operations.

The "TSE_Robotics_main" folder, is the collation area of all the files made from the different members involved in the project in order to create the digital prototype.
